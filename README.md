<h1> Cartel Clicker </h1>

<h2> Idea </h2>
A game about creating your very own legitimate drug bussines. It is based on a well known game concept of games like adventure capitalist and cookie clicker. 
You start in your own garage growing weed and advance from there building your own drug cartel that rules them all.

<h2> Implementation </h2>
After starting to work with LibGdx we chose that we want to implement most of the framework on our own. As of right now we only use very few things like the  SpriteBatcher, Sprites and some other data classes (e.g. Vector2). As development goes on we might manage to go 100% without any external libraries. All animations were hand made as well as most of the icons. Some of them are placeholders that were just copied but they will be replaced in the future.

<h2> Gameplay </h2>
The game is supposed to be balanced like other Idle games. You start out with rapid progress but as time goes on the cost of the upgrades become exponentally more expensive. (see "App Showcase") Another feature that will be implemented is a "prestige" mode, where you can sell all of your businesses but get a flat multiplier on your income so you can progress even faster and further, until you will have to go prestige again.
